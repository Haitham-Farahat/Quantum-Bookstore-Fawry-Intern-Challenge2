# Quantum Bookstore
A simple, extensible C# console application that simulates an online bookstore.
It supports multiple book types (PaperBook, EBook, ShowcaseBook), and allows adding, buying, and removing books from the inventory.

This project demonstrates key OOP principles (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism), and follows the Open/Closed Principle to allow adding new book types without modifying existing code.
